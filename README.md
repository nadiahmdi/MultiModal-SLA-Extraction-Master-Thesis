# Master's Thesis Code (Nadira Ahmadi)

## Overview

This repository contains all the source code, experiments, and supporting materials developed as part of my Master’s thesis.  
Each subfolder corresponds to a specific component, experiment, or stage of the thesis work.

Due to company data privacy and confidentiality constraints, the original real-world datasets cannot be shared. Therefore, all provided data files are masked, modified, or synthetic examples that preserve the structure, format, and processing logic of the original data.

This allows reviewers to:

- Understand the data flow and structure
- Reproduce the pipeline logic
- Inspect code, scripts, and notebooks
- Verify the methodology without access to sensitive company data

 - Human-Evaluation/
 - Data-Preprocessing/
 - Prompt-Testing-VQA/
 - README.md

## Description of Subfolders

Each subfolder contains:

- Its own documentation  
- Required scripts and Jupyter notebooks  
- Environment or dependency information  
- Sample input and output files (`.xlsx`, `.json`, `.txt`)  
- Masked or modified data examples that reflect the original data structure  

### 1. Nanonets-OCR-Project

Contains code, notebooks, and documentation related to OCR-based experiments using **Nanonets**.  
Includes masked document samples demonstrating the OCR input/output structure.

### 2. Florence-2-Project

Includes experiments, scripts, and notebooks related to the **Florence-2** model and its fine-tuning process.  
All example inputs and outputs are modified to remove sensitive information while keeping the original format.

### 3. Human-Evaluation

Contains materials related to human evaluation experiments, including evaluation criteria, templates, and example results with anonymized or synthetic data.

### 4. Data-Preprocessing

Includes preprocessing pipelines, data cleaning scripts, and example datasets demonstrating how raw data is transformed before being used in experiments.

### 5. Prompt-Testing-VQA

Contains prompt design, testing notebooks, and example outputs for Visual Question Answering (VQA) experiments, using masked or synthetic samples.

## Data Privacy Notice

No real company data is included in this submission.

All shared data files are:

- Masked  
- Modified  
- Or synthetically generated  

The purpose of these files is to demonstrate:

- Data structure  
- File formats  
- Processing logic  
- Input/output relationships  

This approach complies with data protection and confidentiality requirements while ensuring transparency and reproducibility of the thesis work.

## Documentation

Each subfolder contains:

- Detailed documentation in Word (`.docx`) and/or PDF (`.pdf`) format  
- Instructions on how to run the code  
- Explanations of the experiments and outputs  

Please refer to the documentation inside each respective folder for component-specific details.
